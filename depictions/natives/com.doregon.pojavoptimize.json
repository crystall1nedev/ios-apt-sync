A fix update is coming soon.\r\n### Raise the FPS!\r\nPojavLauncher can be slow on older devices, anywhere from 1-8 FPS in a detailed and complicated world. Discord moderator Chuck_Norris_ released an optimization modpack for FabricMC that could circumvent this issue and provide even from the game.\r\n\r\nWith his help, I'm glad to announce that __PojavOptimize__, a PojavLauncher optimization pack is now available on my repository. \r\n\r\n### What mods?\r\nSome of the mods included are purely aesthetic, while others serve a real purpose:\r\n\r\n- __Sodium__, which is a massive overhaul of Minecraft's rendering to converse CPU cycles.\r\n- __Starlight__, which rewrites Minecraft's lighting to provide a better experience witohut the overhead.\r\n- __NotEnoughCrashes__, to generate more in-depth crash logs and allow you to continue playing even if the world crashes.\r\n- __Lithium__, to improve game ticks.\r\n- __OKZoomer__, to provide OptiFine-like zooming features.\r\n- __Krypton__, to optimize the networking stack.\r\n- __FerriteCore__, to reduce the memory usage.\r\n- and many more (as seen on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Doregon/PojavOptimize)).\r\n\r\n__This package requires that you have installed Fabric according to the version number!__",
