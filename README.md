# Doregon's iOS Repo

This repo is just one place to hold debs for everyone to enjoy, from me and others to the end users. Here are the packages available.

### Security
If you want to make sure you're getting the packages from this repo (instead of someone else interfering), you can install `doregon-keyring` from Procursus. Elu-strapped jailbreaks (checkra1n standard, unc0ver, anything not Coolstar, really) do not currently have a package available to install.
